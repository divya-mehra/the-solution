    description:
      "The eastern plains of Corsica run twenty degrees colder than the rest of the island. Clementines grow in abundance and are harvested by hand in family-run orchards. They flood the sun-drenched earth in orange. The fruit’s oil extract brightens and tones; its peel reverses time; its juice firms your skin. It runs deep through your pores, leaving you fresh-faced and brand new. This is our promise.",
    description_two: ["Picture this: the Corsican coast dotted with tourists, a stray man and woman seeking answers to discontent in foreign tongue, who grow familiar with one another, wrapping around. Natural beauties draped. He learns to fish. She spins warmth of air. Her skin is soft to the touch, an ethereal glow that people say only comes with a human baking inside.","They take a boat westward and sail so far for so long that while crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, the woman gives birth to a baby girl. They name her Clementine in honor of their beginning. "],

        `Clementine is standing in her bathroom when Jack parachutes through the door and screams the truth: you have no time! He stands there, pointing at his bare wrist and gesticulating wildly. She wonders how he can look so graceful and deranged all at once. He tells her to fix herself up, so they can start again.

        `The face of it, the pure syrupy, glazed donut face of the matter is that 200 years after Chaucer describes beauty as “bright, rosy, fresh, and new,” Elizabeth I of England cakes herself in lead, masking her scars of smallpox. The lead traps her in a cycle of break and repair and she finally dies a virgin in a white mask.

        `Imagine you being a virgin, says Jack. He smirks, missing the whole point. When she doesn't respond, he looks up and asks, are you ready yet?

        `When Clem was young she used to accompany her mother to the powder room, where she sat in awe of the women collecting on plush carpets and flesh-colored chairs. They squeezed shine and sweat from their faces and gossiped about the men outside. To a young Clementine, the floral musk mixed with cigarette smoke emanating off their bodies seemed a dream. They were powerful. They wore knowing smiles and gracious curves. She’d loathe returning to the crowd, where she’d lose her mother to some new vagrant passing through town, and eventually, one of the husbands would stroke her cheek and whisper, there’s a beautiful girl.

        `It wasn’t always like this, Clem thinks, but then maybe it was. Maybe she has no idea what it was really like. She likes to impress her own version of history upon its moldy façade. Big men with big bellies have let its walls rot, thrown meaningless words (sometimes, their best words) over yesteryear, trampling for Sharpies like legions at war because they worry about becoming obsolete even though no one even uses the word yesteryear anymore.

        What an aggravating thing to say: if you say so. The more she says
        it, the stranger is sounds, and her skin starts to peel. Her fingers
        dip inside. She thinks of Elizabeth the First.`,
